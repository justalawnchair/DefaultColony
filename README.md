# Spore-DefaultColony

This Spore mod gives a new tool for the space stage called "Colony Filler". The Colony Filler is a tool that fills in existing colonies with buildings, maximizing spice production.

It will place buildings according to the TScore of the current planet. 

T0 - No buildings
T1 - 4 buildings (1 Entertainment, 2 Industry, 2 Homes)
T2 - 11 buildings (1 Entertainment, 4 Industry, 6 Homes)
T3 - 11 buildings (1 Entertainment, 4 Industry, 6 Homes, 8 Turrets)

Its cost is 300,000 Sporebucks and is available at most alien races. 

## INSTALLATION:

Install the DefaultColony.sporemod file using the Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/
This is required to use the mod. 

KNOWN ISSUES:

- The buildings will not render properly until you leave the planet and return.
- The buildings may not save, so use the tool, go into the Colony Planner (Edit Colony) and save the layout. 
- The default buildings from Sporepedia are inconsistent, so you  may get very ugly cities.
